    https://github.com/verazuo/jailbreak_llms/blob/main/data/README.md
    Jailbraks are divided into 14 categories: Child Sexual Abuse, Illegal Activity, Hate Speech, Malware Generation, 
    Physical Harm, Economic Harm, Fraud, Pornography, Political Lobbying, Privacy Violence, Legal Opinion, Financial Advice, 
    Health Consultation, and Government Decision.
    No chance to cover all of them! 
    Focus on one or few of them only for instance on Illegal Acitvity like trying to disable/bypass llm's security.
